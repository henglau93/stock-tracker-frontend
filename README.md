# stock-tracker
Stock tracker that manage and track outlets' ingredient based on roles.

# Background
I developed the stock tracker using MERN stack, where I use React.js as presentation layer, Express.js and Node.js as middle or application layer, and MongoDB as our database layer.

# Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the command:
```npm start```

It runs the app in the development mode and opens http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view it.
